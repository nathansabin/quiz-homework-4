If the user answer the question correctly, the next question will load. However if the user answers wrong, five second will be taken of the timer before rendering in the next question. This same log will repeat for all three questions. After answering the question you have an option to enter your intials, if you do then a score board will load in and your data will be added to the bottom (name and amount correct). The bottom of the page has a button that will allow you to try again.
